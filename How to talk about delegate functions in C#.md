# C# delegates terms - sketch:## ProblemIn the C# community, there are many terms around the use of "delegate" functions, and there is confusion around these terms.  The terms whose relationships or definitions are confusing include:- delegate- method- anonymous function- lambda- ?instance?I would argue that the terms themselves are a source of confusion, because we are using a new and obtuse term where a familiar and simple term would do.  Also, we are using a single term to refer to different concepts.  ## Where to look for a solution?The JavaScript community has similar language features, and they already have a simple, straightforward way to talk about these language features.  Many JavaScript programmers are very familiar with passing functions as arguments and with return functions from functions, and the terms that JavaScript programmers use to discuss these language features are not a great source of confusion.  They're generally well understood and agreed upon.  I would suggest that we borrow terms from the JavaScript community as a starting point.  ## What would the solution look like, exactly?  Start with the language of the JavaScript community.  It's super simple.  They basically have one term:  "function."  That's it.  For example, they say things like - "pass a function as an argument"- "return a function"- "use a function as an object"These simple, plain-language terms describe all of the things that we do with delegate functions in C#.  And they are already understandable at first glance, even for programmers who are not familiar with delegate functions.  The actions they describe might be mind-bending for someone not familiar with functional programming, but the words themselves are plain and understandable.We couldn't just use these terms as-is, though.  We would need to extend the JavaScript terminology, to account for the unique features of C#.  Basically, I would suggest that we use "delegate" as an adjective when describing a function, like this:  "delegate function".  When we use "delegate" as a noun when referring to a function, we are implying that the delegate function is a brand new thing because we are using a brand new word to refer to it.  But delegate functions are not brand new.  They're just functions.  What is new is that we are using them in a different way.  To describe this new way of using functions, and to describe the relationship between delegate types and functions, we could use language like this:- "Delegate types give us tools that allow us to pass functions as arguments and to return functions."- "Delegate types are a framework for using functions as objects.  They define the types of functions that are passed as arguments or returned."  ## Some more thoughtsDelegates are types.  They are not the thing itself.  The thing itself is a function.  If I tried to teach someone about arguments, but I emphasized the terms "string," "int," and "bool" as the primary terms for describing arguments, I would miss the mark.  String, int, and bool are types; they are not the thing itself.  The thing itself is an argument.  Similarly, talking about delegate functions by focusing on "delegate" as the primary term misses the point.  Delegate is the type.  It is not the thing itself.  The thing itself is a function.  So I would suggest, in order:1.  Let's just use the plain old word "function" when we can.  It's good enough for most things.2.  Where we need the word "delegate" to describe the type system attached to delegate functions in C#, use delegate as an adjective, not as a noun.  3.  Describe delegates as tools for using functions, not as functions in and of themselves.  If we follow these guidelines, our terms for discussing delegate functions will we closer to the terms of the JavaScript community, where the terms for discussing these language features are simple and settled.  More importantly, we will be more precisely reflecting the actual structure of C# in our terminology.
